# Phase 5 ARCH-M6 scaffolding (2026-05-13): block the build when
# api/openapi.yaml changes but web/src/api/generated/ wasn't
# regenerated alongside. The generated tree is git-tracked; running
# `cd web && npm run generate` regenerates from api/openapi.yaml.
#
# Guard logic:
#
#   1. If web/src/api/generated/ does NOT exist yet, do nothing.
#      This phase ships the orval.config.ts scaffolding without
#      running `npm install orval` from the sandbox (disk-full); the
#      first operator-run of `npm run generate` creates the directory
#      and the guard activates from that point forward.
#
#   2. If web/src/api/generated/ exists:
#      - Regenerate into a tmp dir using `npm run generate`
#        (requires orval to be installed locally).
#      - Diff against the tracked tree.
#      - Fail the build with a clear regenerate-command pointer.
#
# Note: this guard requires Node + npm to be available on the CI
# runner. The frontend job in ci.yml already provisions both
# (.github/workflows/ci.yml frontend-build), so wiring is mechanical.
# Run order matters: this guard must run AFTER `npm ci` in the
# frontend job so orval is in node_modules.
