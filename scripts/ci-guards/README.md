# `scripts/ci-guards/` — Regression-guard scripts

Each `<id>.sh` script in this directory pins one closed audit finding from
regressing. CI runs the full set on every push via the
`Regression guards` step in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. Operators can
run any script locally:

```bash
bash scripts/ci-guards/G-3-env-docs-drift.sh
```

## Contract

Every script in this directory MUST:

1. Be exit-code 0 on a clean repo (no regression present).
2. Be exit-code non-zero on regression, with a `::error::` annotation
   prefix so PR reviewers see the failing line in the GitHub Actions UI.
3. **Be runnable from repo root via `bash scripts/ci-guards/<id>.sh`
   with NO arguments and NO env-var requirements.** The CI loop step
   (`for g in scripts/ci-guards/*.sh; do bash "$g"; done`) iterates
   every `.sh` here without args; any script that requires an arg or
   env var WILL fail in that loop.
4. Carry a head-comment block matching the in-source justification
   from the original ci.yml entry: the audit-finding reference, the
   closure rationale, the exempt-surface list (if any).
5. Use `set -e` early to fail-fast on internal command errors.
6. Produce no output on the happy path beyond a final
   `echo "<id>: clean."` confirmation line.

### Helpers vs guards

Scripts that consume input artifacts (a test-output log, a
`coverage.out` file) or env vars (`PR_NUMBER`, `GH_TOKEN`) are
HELPERS, not guards. They live in `scripts/`, NOT `scripts/ci-guards/`.

Current helpers:
- `scripts/vendor-e2e-skip-check.sh` — consumes `test-output.log`
  arg from the deploy-vendor-e2e job
- `scripts/coverage-pr-comment.sh` — consumes `coverage.out` +
  `PR_NUMBER` + `GH_TOKEN` env from the go-build-and-test job
- `scripts/check-coverage-thresholds.sh` — consumes `coverage.out`
  + `.github/coverage-thresholds.yml`

## Adding a new guard

1. Drop a new `<id>.sh` in this directory with the head-comment block
   describing the audit finding it closes.
2. Make it executable: `chmod +x scripts/ci-guards/<id>.sh`.
3. Verify it fails on a deliberate regression and passes on clean repo.
4. CI auto-picks up new scripts via the `for g in scripts/ci-guards/*.sh`
   loop in the `Regression guards` step — no ci.yml change required.

## Guards in this directory

Count: re-derive on demand via `ls scripts/ci-guards/*.sh | wc -l`. The table below names each one — keep it in sync as guards are added.

### Forward-looking guards (Auditable Codebase Bundle, post-v2.1.0 anti-rot)

These guards catch defect classes BEFORE they get audit findings — they pin invariants on the codebase that the v2.0 audit history showed are easy to lose.

| ID | Item | Catches |
|---|---|---|
| `complete-path-config-coverage` | post-v2.1.0 / item-1 | "Lying field" — `CERTCTL_*` env var defined in `internal/config/config.go` that no consumer outside `internal/config/` actually reads. Operator-facing config that the docs claim works but the code never honors. Companion Go test at `internal/config/coverage_test.go`. |
| `doc-rot-detector` | post-v2.1.0 / item-5 | Docs older than 90 days warn (yellow), older than 120 days fail (red). Uses HEAD commit timestamp for reproducibility. `docs/archive/` allowlisted in bulk. |

The cold-DB compose smoke (post-v2.1.0 / item-6) is NOT a script in this directory — it is inlined directly into `.github/workflows/ci.yml::cold-db-compose-smoke` because there is no value in a developer running it locally (the whole point of the gate is that CI owns the cold-DB state). To inspect or modify the smoke logic, read that workflow job; there is intentionally no `scripts/ci-guards/cold-db-compose-smoke.sh`.

The fourth Bundle artifact (`internal/ciparity/`) is Go tests, not shell guards — runs under the standard Go test step. Pins the MCP tool catalogue floor + naming convention; reports CLI/MCP/OpenAPI surface counts as a trend metric.


## Running the full set locally

```bash
for g in scripts/ci-guards/*.sh; do
  echo "=== $(basename "$g") ==="
  bash "$g" || echo "  FAILED"
done
```

## ARCH-H1 OpenAPI exception two-bucket contract (Phase 13 Sprint 13.1)

`api/openapi-handler-exceptions.yaml` lists every router route that is intentionally NOT in `api/openapi.yaml`. Each entry carries a required `category:` field with one of two values:

- **`category: wire-protocol`** — the route's wire shape is dictated by an IETF RFC (SCEP RFC 8894, ACME RFC 8555, ACME ARI RFC 9773, EST RFC 7030) or it's a sibling/shorthand variant of one. The canonical reference for these endpoints lives in `docs/acme-server.md` + `docs/operator/scep.md` + `docs/operator/est.md` — duplicating their wire contract in `openapi.yaml` would add no information. **Wire-protocol entries never burn down.**

- **`category: rest-deferred`** — the route is REST-shaped (resource CRUD, JSON request/response, RBAC-gated) but its OpenAPI operation was deferred when the handler shipped. **Rest-deferred entries must monotonically decrease to zero.** Authoring an OpenAPI op for a deferred route + deleting the corresponding exception entry + decrementing `api/openapi-handler-exceptions-baseline.txt` in the same PR is the canonical close path.

### Adding a new exception entry

The default category for new entries is `rest-deferred`. Only set `wire-protocol` when:

1. The `why:` field cites a specific RFC anchor (e.g. "RFC 8555 §7.1.1 directory"), AND
2. The route's wire shape is dictated by the RFC (not a REST resource that happens to live alongside one).

When in doubt, default to `rest-deferred` and author the OpenAPI op. The two guards in this directory enforce both buckets:

- `openapi-handler-parity.sh` reports bucket counts + fails on missing/unknown `category:` fields + fails on stale exceptions / undocumented router routes.
- `openapi-rest-deferred-monotonic.sh` fails if `rest-deferred` grows vs the baseline file at `api/openapi-handler-exceptions-baseline.txt`.

### Inspecting bucket counts

```bash
# Full report.
bash scripts/ci-guards/openapi-handler-parity.sh

# Just one bucket count (used by sibling guards).
bash scripts/ci-guards/openapi-handler-parity.sh --bucket=wire-protocol
bash scripts/ci-guards/openapi-handler-parity.sh --bucket=rest-deferred
```
