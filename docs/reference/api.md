# OpenAPI Specification Guide

> Last reviewed: 2026-05-05

certctl ships with a complete OpenAPI 3.1 specification at `api/openapi.yaml`. The spec documents every operation (re-derive count via `grep -cE '^\s+operationId:' api/openapi.yaml`), every request/response schema, pagination conventions, authentication requirements, and error formats. It's the single source of truth for the documented REST API.

This guide covers how to use the spec for API exploration, client SDK generation, and integration testing.

## Where to Find It

The spec lives at `api/openapi.yaml` in the repository root. It's versioned alongside the code and updated with every API change.

```bash
# View the spec
cat api/openapi.yaml

# Count operations (includes health + ready)
grep -cE '^\s+operationId:' api/openapi.yaml
```

## Viewing with Swagger UI

The fastest way to explore the API interactively is Swagger UI. Run it as a Docker container pointing at the spec:

```bash
# From the certctl repo root
docker run -p 8080:8080 \
  -e SWAGGER_JSON=/spec/openapi.yaml \
  -v $(pwd)/api:/spec \
  swaggerapi/swagger-ui
```

Open http://localhost:8080 to see the full API reference with "Try it out" buttons for every endpoint.

Alternatively, use Redoc for a cleaner read-only view:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:80 \
  -e SPEC_URL=/spec/openapi.yaml \
  -v $(pwd)/api:/usr/share/nginx/html/spec \
  redocly/redoc
```

## API Structure

The spec organizes endpoints into 16 tags:

| Tag | Endpoints | Description |
|-----|-----------|-------------|
| Certificates | 12 | CRUD, versions, renewal, deployment, revocation, deployments |
| CRL & OCSP | 3 | JSON CRL, DER CRL per issuer, OCSP responder |
| Issuers | 5 | CA connector management |
| Targets | 5 | Deployment target management |
| Agents | 7 | Registration, heartbeat, CSR submission, work polling |
| Jobs | 5 | Job queue with approve/reject |
| Policies | 5 | Policy rules and violations |
| Profiles | 5 | Certificate enrollment profiles |
| Teams | 5 | Team management |
| Owners | 5 | Certificate owners |
| Agent Groups | 5 | Dynamic agent grouping |
| Audit | 2 | Immutable audit trail |
| Notifications | 3 | Notification events |
| Stats | 5 | Dashboard statistics |
| Metrics | 1 | System metrics |
| Health | 3 | Health, readiness, auth info |

## Authentication

The spec declares a `bearerAuth` security scheme applied globally. All endpoints under `/api/v1/` require a Bearer token by default:

```bash
# The default compose stack uses a self-signed cert; pin with --cacert
curl --cacert ./deploy/test/certs/ca.crt \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-api-key" \
  https://localhost:8443/api/v1/certificates
```

Three endpoints are exempt from auth (declared with `security: []` in the spec): `/health`, `/ready`, and `/api/v1/auth/info`. The auth info endpoint tells clients whether authentication is enabled and what type is required — useful for GUIs that need to show/hide a login screen.

## Pagination Convention

All list endpoints follow the same pagination pattern:

**Request parameters:**
- `page` (integer, default 1) — page number
- `per_page` (integer, default 50, max 500) — results per page

**Response envelope:**
```json
{
  "data": [...],
  "total": 150,
  "page": 1,
  "per_page": 50
}
```

Certificates also support cursor-based pagination for large datasets:
- `cursor` (string) — opaque cursor token from previous response
- `page_size` (integer) — results per page when using cursor mode

## Generating Client SDKs

The OpenAPI spec can generate typed client libraries for any language. Here are examples using common generators:

### TypeScript (openapi-typescript-codegen)

```bash
npx openapi-typescript-codegen \
  --input api/openapi.yaml \
  --output src/generated/certctl \
  --client axios
```

### Python (openapi-python-client)

```bash
pip install openapi-python-client
openapi-python-client generate --path api/openapi.yaml
```

### Go (oapi-codegen)

```bash
go install github.com/oapi-codegen/oapi-codegen/v2/cmd/oapi-codegen@latest
oapi-codegen -generate types,client -package certctl api/openapi.yaml > certctl_client.go
```

### Java (OpenAPI Generator)

```bash
npx @openapitools/openapi-generator-cli generate \
  -i api/openapi.yaml \
  -g java \
  -o generated/java-client
```

## Validating the Spec

Verify the spec is valid OpenAPI 3.1:

```bash
# Using spectral (recommended)
npx @stoplight/spectral-cli lint api/openapi.yaml

# Using swagger-cli
npx @apidevtools/swagger-cli validate api/openapi.yaml
```

## Using with Postman

Import the spec directly into Postman:

1. Open Postman → Import → File → select `api/openapi.yaml`
2. Postman creates a collection with every documented operation organized by tag
3. Set the `baseUrl` variable to `https://localhost:8443` (HTTPS-only as of v2.2)
4. Add an `Authorization: Bearer your-api-key` header to the collection
5. Import the demo stack CA bundle (`deploy/test/certs/ca.crt`) into Postman's Settings → Certificates → CA Certificates, or disable certificate verification for the `localhost` host (Settings → General → SSL certificate verification)

## Key Schemas

The spec defines typed schemas for all domain objects. Key schemas to know:

| Schema | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `ManagedCertificate` | Core certificate record with status, expiry, owner, tags, profile |
| `CertificateVersion` | Individual cert version with PEM, serial, fingerprint, validity |
| `Agent` | Agent with heartbeat, metadata (OS, arch, IP, version), capabilities |
| `Job` | Job record with type, status (7 states), certificate/target references |
| `PolicyRule` | Policy with type (5 types), config, severity, enabled state |
| `CertificateProfile` | Enrollment profile with allowed key types, max TTL, constraints |
| `AuditEvent` | Immutable audit record with actor, action, resource, timestamp |
| `RevocationReason` | RFC 5280 reason code enum (8 values) |
| `DashboardSummary` | Aggregate stats (total certs, expiring, agents, jobs) |

## Integration Testing

Use the spec to generate contract tests that verify the API matches the spec:

```bash
# Using schemathesis for fuzz testing against the spec
pip install schemathesis
# The default compose stack uses a self-signed cert — export a CA bundle or set REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE
export REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE=$(pwd)/deploy/test/certs/ca.crt
schemathesis run api/openapi.yaml \
  --base-url https://localhost:8443 \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer your-api-key"
```

This sends randomized valid requests to every endpoint and verifies the responses match the declared schemas.
