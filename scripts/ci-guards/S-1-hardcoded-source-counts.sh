# S-1 master closed cat-s1-9ce1cbe26876 (README + features.md
# stale numeric counts; explicit violation of project guidelines per
# "version-stamped numbers rot") and
# cat-s1-features_md_issuer_count_contradiction (features.md
# self-disagreed on issuer count: 9 vs 12 in the same doc).
# The fix replaced source-derived numbers in prose with
# "rebuild via <command>" patterns documented in the project guidelines under
# "Current-state commands". This script grep-fails the build if
# any of the previously-stale sites reintroduces a hardcoded
# count.
#
# Allowed surfaces: demo-fixture prose in README ("32
# certificates" — those are seed_demo.sql facts, not live
# source counts), the testing-guide example phrasing
# ("README claims 8 issuer connectors but only 6 exist"),
# and any number that quotes the source command immediately
# adjacent.
#
# See coverage-gap-audit-2026-04-24-v5/unified-audit.md
# cat-s1-9ce1cbe26876 + cat-s1-features_md_issuer_count_contradiction
# for closure rationale.
