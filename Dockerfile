# Multi-stage build for certctl server
#
# Bundle A / Audit H-001 (CWE-829): every FROM line is pinned to an
# immutable digest in addition to the human-readable tag. The tag is
# advisory; the digest is what Docker actually pulls. A registry-side
# tag swap (the documented prior-art for tag-only pulls being unsafe)
# can no longer change the build.
#
# Bump procedure (operator):
#   1. Quarterly cadence (or sooner if a CVE lands on a base image).
#   2. For each FROM:
#        docker pull <image>:<tag>
#        docker manifest inspect <image>:<tag> | grep -m1 digest
#      OR via Docker Hub Registry API:
#        curl -sSL https://hub.docker.com/v2/repositories/library/<image>/tags/<tag> \
#          | jq -r .digest
#   3. Replace the @sha256:... portion of the FROM line.
#   4. Run `docker build` locally + verify CI.
#   5. Commit with the bump procedure cited in the message body.
#
# The CI step "Forbidden bare FROM regression guard (H-001)" rejects
# any future commit that lands a FROM without an @sha256 pin.

# Bundle A / Audit M-014: explicit retry loop for `npm ci`. Pre-bundle
# this was `npm ci || npm ci && tsc && build` — the bash precedence is
# `A || (B && C && D)` so the second `npm ci` only ran on the failure
# path of the first, but the `tsc && build` chain only ran on the
# success path of the second. Net effect: a transient registry blip
# turned the build into a silent skip of the production step.
#
# New shape: a deterministic 3-attempt retry with 5-second backoff and
# an explicit `[ -d node_modules ]` post-check so a silent failure is
# impossible.

# Image-level HEALTHCHECK for bare `docker run` / Docker Swarm / Nomad / ECS.
#
# U-2 (P1, cat-u-healthcheck_protocol_mismatch): pre-U-2 this probe used
# `curl -f http://localhost:8443/health`, which always failed against the
# HTTPS-only listener (HTTPS-Everywhere milestone, v2.2 / tag v2.0.47 —
# `cmd/server/main.go::ListenAndServeTLS`, no plaintext fallback, TLS 1.3
# pinned). Operators outside docker-compose / Helm saw permanent
# `unhealthy` status and a restart-loop the first time they pulled the
# image. The compose stack overrides this HEALTHCHECK with `--cacert` to
# the bootstrap CA bundle (deploy/docker-compose.yml:126); the Helm chart
# uses explicit `httpGet` probes with `scheme: HTTPS` and ignores Docker's
# HEALTHCHECK; every example compose file in `examples/*/docker-compose.yml`
# overrides with `curl -sfk https://localhost:8443/health`. This image-
# level probe is for the bare-`docker run` consumer ONLY.
#
# `-k` (insecure) is acceptable here because the probe is localhost-to-
# localhost: the same process serving the cert is being probed; the probe
# never traverses a network. Pinning a `--cacert` is not viable for the
# published image because the bootstrap cert is per-deploy (generated into
# the `certs` named volume on first up; operator-supplied via Helm's
# `existingSecret` or cert-manager). Compose / Helm / examples already
# perform full cert-chain validation and are unaffected.
#
# CI grep guardrail at .github/workflows/ci.yml ("Forbidden plaintext
# HEALTHCHECK regression guard (U-2)") blocks reintroduction of the
# `http://` shape. Image-level integration test in
# deploy/test/healthcheck_test.go pins the contract end-to-end.
