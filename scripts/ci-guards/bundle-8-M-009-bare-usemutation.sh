# Audit M-009 + M-029 Pass 1 closure:
#
# Pre-Bundle-8 the codebase had 56 bare useMutation sites with
# discretionary invalidation. Bundle 8 shipped the useTrackedMutation
# wrapper (web/src/hooks/useTrackedMutation.ts) that requires every
# caller to declare `invalidates: QueryKey[] | 'noop'`. M-029 Pass 1
# then migrated all 56 sites to the wrapper across 6 batches.
#
# This guard pins the contract going forward: every useMutation call
# in src/ MUST be inside useTrackedMutation.ts (the wrapper itself
# is the only legitimate caller of useMutation). Any bare useMutation
# call elsewhere is a regression — adding a new mutation site means
# going through the wrapper so the invalidates contract is enforced
# per-site, not by a soft budget guard.
#
# If you genuinely need raw useMutation (extremely unlikely — the
# wrapper supports invalidates: 'noop' for fire-and-forget mutations),
# update this guard's exclusion list and document the carve-out.

set -e
# Test files (web/src/**/*.test.{ts,tsx}) are excluded so existing
# useMutation-mocking test patterns and the wrapper's own unit
# tests don't trip the production guard — symmetric with L-015
# and L-019 above.
#
# Sprint 5 ARCH-001-A carve-out (2026-05-16): web/src/api/generated/**
# is the Orval-generated React Query layer (TanStack Query client
# mode, tags-split). Orval's mutation template calls bare useMutation
# directly — by design, because the generated layer is one
# abstraction below the wrapper. The Composition pattern is: hand-
# written feature code consumes the generated hooks AND wraps any
# mutation through useTrackedMutation at the call site (which routes
# through the generated hook's mutationFn under the hood). Adding the
# wrapper inside the generated tree would be overwritten on every
# regenerate, so the contract is "wrapper at the feature layer, not
# the codegen layer." The drift guard (openapi-codegen-drift.sh)
# already pins the generated tree against the canonical openapi.yaml,
# so this exclusion can't be abused to smuggle in a hand-edit.
