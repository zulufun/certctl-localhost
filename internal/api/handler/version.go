// VersionHandler exposes the running server's build identity at
// /api/v1/version. U-3 ride-along (cat-u-no_version_endpoint, P2): pre-U-3
// there was no in-band way for an operator (or an automated rollout system)
// to ask "what version of certctl is this binary?" — they had to either read
// the container image tag externally or trust whatever the README said. The
// gap matters for the same operability story U-3 closes: when fresh-clone
// quickstarts fail, the very first question is "what code did I actually
// build", and the only honest answer needs to come from the binary itself.
//
// VersionInfo is populated from three sources, in priority order:
//
//  1. The Version field — typically supplied at build time via
//     `-ldflags='-X github.com/zulufun/certctl-localhost/internal/api/handler.Version=v2.0.50'`.
//     Production releases set this from the git tag (see release.yml).
//
//  2. runtime/debug.ReadBuildInfo() — populated by Go 1.18+ for any binary
//     built from a module. Provides the VCS commit SHA, dirty flag, and
//     build timestamp. We read these fields directly so a `go build` from a
//     working tree (no -ldflags incantation) still produces a useful
//     /api/v1/version payload — the failure mode pre-U-3 was that everything
//     looked like "dev" everywhere, which made "is the bug fixed in this
//     binary" unanswerable.
//
//  3. Static fallbacks ("dev" / "unknown") — only reached when neither
//     ldflags nor build-info are populated, which in practice means
//     `go run` from a non-VCS-tracked workspace.
//
// The handler runs through the no-auth bypass dispatch in cmd/server/main.go
// so probes and rollout systems can query it without presenting Bearer
// credentials, mirroring how /health and /ready are reachable. Audit logging
// excludes /api/v1/version for the same reason — the path is hot under
// rollout polling and would otherwise dominate the audit trail.
type VersionHandler struct{}

// Version is overridden at build time via:
//
//	-ldflags='-X github.com/zulufun/certctl-localhost/internal/api/handler.Version=<tag>'
//
// release.yml does this for the server container and CLI/agent binaries.
// The empty default (rather than "dev") lets the Handler fall back to the
// runtime/debug VCS revision when ldflags wasn't supplied — preferable to
// returning a literal "dev" that masks the actual git SHA the binary was
// built from.

// Field ordering and tag names are part of the contract — operator tooling
