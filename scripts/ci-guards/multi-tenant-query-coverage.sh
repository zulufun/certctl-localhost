# Auth Bundle 2 / Phase 13 — multi-tenant query guard (forward-compat
# protection, ratchet-style).
#
# Goal:
#   Bundle 2 ships single-tenant only (the seeded `t-default` tenant).
#   This guard is forward-compat protection so a future Bundle 3 /
#   managed-service tenant activation can flip the multi-tenant
#   switch without finding silent tenant-data-leak bugs in shipped
#   queries.
#
# Behavior:
#   Counts every SELECT / UPDATE / DELETE FROM / INSERT INTO statement
#   in internal/repository/postgres/*.go (excluding *_test.go) that
#   targets a tenant-aware table AND lacks a `tenant_id` clause within
#   the surrounding 7-line window. Compares the count against the
#   baseline pinned in this script.
#
#   If count > baseline → FAIL (a new query was added that doesn't
#   carry tenant_id; either add the clause or — if legitimately
#   tenant-spanning — document it in the source comments AND lift the
#   baseline). The guard refuses to silently approve new violations.
#
#   If count < baseline → FAIL (improvements were made; lower the
#   baseline in this script). The guard refuses to silently let the
#   ratchet slip backward.
#
#   If count == baseline → PASS.
#
# Tenant-aware tables (10):
#   Bundle 1 (RBAC primitive, migration 000029):
#     roles, role_permissions, actor_roles
#     (permissions is global — canonical permission catalogue.)
#   Bundle 2 (OIDC + sessions + users + break-glass, migrations 34-38):
#     oidc_providers, group_role_mappings, sessions,
#     session_signing_keys, oidc_pre_login_sessions, users,
#     breakglass_credentials
#
# Why ratchet not zero:
#   The current single-tenant codebase has many Get-by-PK queries
#   (e.g. `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1`) where the primary key
#   is globally unique and the lack of tenant_id is not a leak. Going
#   to zero would require either (a) adding `AND tenant_id = $N` to
#   every PK query — defense-in-depth but mechanical churn — or (b)
#   maintaining a long exception list. The ratchet captures the
#   current state as a baseline; multi-tenant activation work then has
#   to either lower the baseline (good — defense-in-depth applied) or
#   keep it constant (acceptable — single-tenant invariant intact).
#   New code that ADDS to the count without operator review is what
#   we want to catch.
#
# Run:
#   bash scripts/ci-guards/multi-tenant-query-coverage.sh

# Baseline: number of tenant-aware queries that legitimately lack
# tenant_id today (Bundle 2 / Phase 13 close, 2026-05-10). Multi-
# tenant activation work in a future bundle should drive this number
# down; this guard makes any drift from the baseline visible at
# `make verify` time.
#
# To rebase: re-run the guard, set BASELINE_COUNT to the new value,
# include the rebase commit's SHA in the "last rebase" comment.

# userRetentionLoop walks every tenant's deactivated users on the
# same tick; the retention policy is control-plane-wide, not
# per-tenant. Documented inline in the SQL comment.
