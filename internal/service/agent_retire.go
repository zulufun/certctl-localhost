// I-004 coverage-gap closure: the agent retirement surface.
//
// Before 000015, DELETE /api/v1/agents/{id} hard-deleted the agents row and
// the deployment_targets.agent_id FK CASCADE cleaned up downstream rows with
// no preflight, no archival, and no knowledge of in-flight jobs. Any cert
// still rotating through one of those targets would observe half-migrated
// state. I-004 closes that gap with a preflight + soft-retire + optional
// forced-cascade contract; the symbols in this file are the service-layer
// surface that the handler and operator UI bind against.

// ErrAgentIsSentinel is returned when an operator tries to retire one of the
// four reserved sentinel agent IDs (server-scanner, cloud-aws-sm,
// cloud-azure-kv, cloud-gcp-sm). These rows back the network scanner and the
// three cloud secret-manager discovery sources; retiring any of them orphans
// its subsystem. The guard fires unconditionally — force=true does not bypass
// it, because a sentinel is a structural invariant of the deployment, not
// a piece of fleet state the operator owns. Handler maps this to HTTP 403.
var ErrAgentIsSentinel = errors.New("agent is a reserved sentinel and cannot be retired")

// ErrBlockedByDependencies is returned by RetireAgent when at least one of
// (active targets, active certificates, pending jobs) referencing the agent
// is non-zero and force=false. The caller always receives it wrapped in
// a *BlockedByDependenciesError (see below), so handlers doing errors.As
// can surface the per-bucket counts in the 409 body for operator
// troubleshooting. Tests use errors.Is; handlers use errors.As.
var ErrBlockedByDependencies = errors.New("agent has active downstream dependencies")

// ErrForceReasonRequired is returned when force=true is supplied without a
// non-empty reason. The force escape hatch is deliberately chatty: operators
// pulling the emergency cord must leave an auditable breadcrumb explaining
// why a cascade was justified. Handler maps this to HTTP 400 so the operator
// retries with --reason rather than silently skipping the guard. Checked
// before any DB mutation to keep the no-reason path transactionally clean.
var ErrForceReasonRequired = errors.New("force=true requires a non-empty reason")

// ErrAgentRetired is returned by Heartbeat (and any future agent-authenticated
// call site) when a retired agent is still polling. The handler layer maps
// this to HTTP 410 Gone so the cmd/agent sendHeartbeat loop can detect it
// deterministically and shut down the agent process, rather than looping
// forever on a soft-retired identity. IsRetired() on the domain model is
// the single source of truth; the sentinel exists so service and handler
// callers can errors.Is against one symbol.

// body without reshaping fields. Unwrap() satisfies errors.Is against the
// sentinel; Error() includes the counts so logs are diagnostic on their own.

// RetireAgent implements the I-004 retirement contract. Ordering matters —

//
//  1. Sentinel check (unconditional; force does not bypass).
//  2. Fetch agent (404 surfaces as-is from the repo).
//  3. Already-retired idempotency: return AlreadyRetired=true with NO new
//     audit event — the original retire already recorded one.
//  4. Preflight count pass via the three CountActive* repo methods.
//  5. Force-reason guard: force=true with empty reason is rejected here,
//     after the counts are known but before any mutation.
//  6. Default no-force path: any non-zero count returns
//     *BlockedByDependenciesError with counts attached.
//  7. Mutation: SoftRetire (no cascade) or RetireAgentWithCascade, with
//     a single retiredAt timestamp pinned BEFORE the repo call so the
//     audit event and the DB row agree to the nanosecond.
//  8. Audit: agent_retired always; agent_retirement_cascaded additionally
//     on the force=true cascade path.

// Actor comes from the handler's resolveActor (API key → user, agent key →
// agent-<id>, unauthenticated → "anonymous"); the service does not second-
